            <h1 class="hero-title">Build A Superhero</h1>
            <p>The origin story is where your hero is from. It explains who your hero is, where they came from, and what
                inspired them to become a hero. To start this off, think about an event or experience that could be what
                inspired them to become a superhero. It can be a thirst for revenge on someone or something that wronged
                them, or an urge to help people. It could be that they fell in a vat of radiation or they were born on a
                different planet. It doesn’t have to be tragic at all, but it should be important. A strong origin story
                connects your hero's powers, values, and goals.</p>

On the right hand side of your screen is a Notes tab. For each and every section here, I recommend you write down in the notes tab what you want pertaining to that section. Step 7 is a summary of all your notes, and when you’re finished you will be able to get all of your information in one place to be able to paste it into an AI software of your choosing to see what your superhero looks like!"

If your hero is quiet, maybe they have telekinesis, invisibility, and super intelligence. It can go on, but for this section it’s important to think of something that matches your hero best. Try to give him about 1 or 2 powers, or even give them none like Batman, completely up to you."

It can be a physical weakness, similar to Superman’s kryptonite, or it can be an emotional weakness such as the guilt Spider-Man feels. The key to this step is to make the weakness kind of connected to their strengths. If you have a hero in your mind who is stronger in the light then maybe they become vulnerable in the dark. Or if your hero is invisible, their weakness could be when it’s raining or snowing. This part is what makes your hero relatable, since it gives other villains a way to challenge themselves."

Does it help them fight? Does it protect their identity? You can describe it as much as you want in the notes on the right. Next is good to also think about the color scheme of it. Some colors reflect different meanings such as blue for calmness and red for boldness. You could also even tell the AI software to add a symbol of your description onto the hero."

You can choose the name “Pyro” for someone who makes fire and it can be straightforward or you can choose the name “Pheonix” which holds a more symbolic meaning of someone who always rises from defeat. Say your name outloud when you have it, and see if it sounds good. Test out different versions to see which feels most natural for your characters world and tone."
